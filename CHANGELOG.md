# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Tenant context is now mandatory across commands:
  - `--tenant <id>` (or `FORGE_TENANT_ID`)
  - `--tenant-profile-ref <path>` (or `FORGE_TENANT_PROFILE_REF`)
- Added tenant profile loader/validator with fail-fast behavior when profile is missing,
  unreadable, malformed, or mismatched with `--tenant`.
- Generated hooks/settings/test-autogen commands now include tenant arguments by default.
- CI `quality-gate` now checks out `forge-tenant-profiles` with
  `FORGE_TENANT_PROFILES_READ_TOKEN` (fallback `GITHUB_TOKEN`) for private cross-repo access.
- `quality-gate` now falls back to a local `acme-sandbox` profile when cross-repo checkout is
  unavailable, keeping CI deterministic while preserving tenant-context enforcement.

### Fixed

- Removed vulnerable regex parsing paths in `src/tenant-profile.ts` by replacing line parsing with
  deterministic string-based parsing helpers.
- Added regression coverage for YAML inline-comment profile parsing.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- New `test-autogen` command for default test generation and enforcement:
  - `npx forge-ai-init test-autogen --staged --write --check`
  - `npx forge-ai-init test-autogen --check --json`
- New governance skill template: `.claude/skills/test-autogen/SKILL.md`
- New generated git hooks for non-agent execution:
  - `.githooks/pre-commit`
  - `.githooks/pre-push`
  - `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh`
- New weekly learning workflow:
  - `.github/workflows/test-autogen-learning.yml`
  - Generates metadata-only learning report and opens a manual-review PR
- Test-autogen telemetry and audit metadata:
  - `.forge/test-autogen-telemetry.jsonl`
  - `.forge/test-autogen-audit.jsonl`
  - `.forge/test-autogen-baseline.json`
- Checker now verifies `test-autogen` skill presence and `test-autogen` commit hook.

### Changed

- `generateSettings()` commit hook now runs test autogen before quality score gate.
- Standard tier skills: 3 → 4. Enterprise tier skills: 7 → 8.

### Fixed

- Hardened internal git command execution in `test-autogen` by removing shell command strings.
- Refined `test-autogen` tests to avoid insecure temporary path and command invocation patterns.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **Rich markdown scan reports** — `--format markdown` now produces visually appealing PR comments with severity icons, collapsible sections, strengths/weaknesses analysis, category breakdown tables, hot files, and actionable recommendations. Clean projects show a strengths section; projects with findings get categorized tables with severity badges and improvement suggestions.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **`--format` flag now works without `--output`** — `migrate`, `assess`, and `gate` commands output clean markdown/JSON/SARIF to stdout when `--format` is specified, even without `--output <path>`. Previously, `--format` was silently ignored without `--output`, causing colored terminal output (ANSI escape codes) to appear in CI workflows that captured stdout for PR comments.

### Added

- `gate --format markdown` support — quality gate results as clean markdown for CI posting
